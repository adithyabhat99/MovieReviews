While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasnt seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome.</h2><form action='feedback' method='POST' >Feedback<input type='text' name='feedback'><input type='submit' value='feedb'></form><a href='home.html'>Home</a><br><a href='logout'>Logout</a></body></html>
