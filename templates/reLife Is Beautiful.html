Most everyone knows this very popular and honored film, so I wont belabor the story. Briefly, in my humble opinion, this film deserves all the accolades its been awarded. A near perfect film, my only gripe is that Mr. Benignis performance could have been more understated, especially the half of the film thats set in the concentration camp. But this is only a slight complaint. For a joyful, life-affirming movie, Life Is Beautiful is tops. But be forewarned, as its principal backdrop of anti-Semitism and Nazi murder, it is not a very happy movie</h2><form action='feedback' method='POST' >Feedback<input type='text' name='feedback'><input type='submit' class="btn btn-primary" value='feedb'></form><a href='home.html'>Home</a><br><a href='logout'>Logout</a></body></html>
