Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). </h2><form action='feedback' method='POST' >Feedback<input type='text' name='feedback'><input type='submit' class="btn btn-primary" value='feedb'></form><a href='home.html'>Home</a><br><a href='logout'>Logout</a></body></html>
