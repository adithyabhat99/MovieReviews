You name it- Seven, The Usual Suspects, etc., etc., etc. I remember my friend being so obsessed with Silence of the Lambs, that it drove me crazy. And I hated the movie naturally and refused to see it. But everyone told me that I have to see this, so I let my guard down. And had an open mind, and Im glad I did. My friend was right, this is a great movie. It is so well acted, I couldnt even describe. I loved Silence of the Lambs and would recommend it to anyone. Its creepy and exciting. Trust me, youll love it.</h2><form action='feedback' method='POST' >Feedback<input type='text' name='feedback'><input type='submit' value='feedb'></form><a href='home.html'>Home</a><br><a href='logout'>Logout</a></body></html>
