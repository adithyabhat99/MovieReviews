From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word go. The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.</h2><form action='feedback' method='POST' >Feedback<input type='text' name='feedback'><input class="btn btn-primary" type='submit' value='feedb'></form><a href='home.html'>Home</a><br><a href='logout'>Logout</a></body></html>
